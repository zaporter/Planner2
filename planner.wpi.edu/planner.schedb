The mixing of material from different academic  disciplines is deliberate, and meant to counter the notion that human pursuits  are “naturally” arranged in the neat packages found in the modern university. The  course draws upon the physical and social sciences, and the humanities, to  examine how those fields relate to one another, and how they produce knowledge  and self-knowledge. Cultural as well as disciplinary factors are assessed in this  process.   Light, Vision and Understanding is conducted as a seminar. The diverse  collection of reading materials includes a number of primary texts in different fields. In addition, the students keep a journal in which they record the results of numerous individual observations and experiments concerning light and visual  perception. The course can fit into several Humanities and Arts topic areas as  well as serve as a starting point for an IQP.

II Computer simulations are becoming increasingly important in understanding and predicting the behavior of a wide variety of biological systems, ranging from metastasis of cancer cells, to spread of disease in an epidemic, to management of natural resources such as fisheries and forests. In this course, students will learn to use a graphical programming language to simulate biological systems. Most of the classroom time will be spent working individually or in groups, first learning the language, and then programming simulation projects. We will also discuss several papers on biological simulations from the primary scientific literature. In constructing and comparing their simulations, students will demonstrate for themselves how relatively simple behavioral rules followed by individual molecules, cells, or organisms can result in complex system behaviors. Recommended background: Students taking this course must have a solid background in a biological area they would like to simulate, at about the depth provided by a BB 3000 level class.

Students are introduced to the fundamental theme of materials science-- structureproperty-processing relationships in biomaterials, specifically metals, ceramics, and plastics. Aspects of material structure range from the atomic to microstructural and macroscopic scales. In turn, these structural features determine the properties of materials. In particular, this course investigates connections between structure and mechanical properties, and how working and thermal treatments may transform structure and thus alter material properties. This knowledge is then applied to material selection decisions for the design of medical devices and engineered tissues.

<course number="531" name="BIOMATERIALS IN THE DESIGN OF MEDICAL DEVICES" course_desc="Biomaterials are an integral part of medical devices,  implants, controlled drug delivery systems, and  tissue engineered constructs. Extensive research  efforts have been expended on understanding  how biologic systems interact with biomaterials.  Meanwhile, controversy has revolved around  biomaterials and their availability as a result of  the backlash to the huge liability resulting from  controversies related to material and processing  shortcomings of medical devices. This course specifically  addresses the unique role of biomaterials  in medical device design and the use of emerging  biomaterials technology in medical devices. The  need to understand design requirements of medical devices based on safety and efficacy will be  addressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if  testing fails to account for synergistic interactions  from chronic loading, aqueous environments,  and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies  are readily available to assess accelerated effects of  loading in physiologic-like environments. This  combined with subchronic effects of animal implants  is a potential tool in assessing durability. It  is difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total  biologic environment. The ultimate determination  of safety comes not only from following the  details of regulations, but with an understanding  of potential failure modes and designs that lowers  the risk of these failures. This course will evaluate  biomaterials and their properties as related to the design and reliability of medical devices." min-credits="3" max-credits="4.5" grade-type="normal">

<course number="1030" name="KINETICS, EQUILIBRIUM AND THERMODYNAMICS" course_desc="Cat. I   This course will examine the dynamic nature of solutions at the molecular level, and will develop an understanding of the mathematical aspects of molecular dynamics and equilibrium. Reaction kinetics will be outlined in detail leading into exploration of various fundamentals and examples of equilibrium processes in the gas phase as well as in solution, including acid-base chemistry and precipitation.   Principles of thermodynamics will be introduced (entropy, free energy), and relationships with equilibrium will be explored.  Case studies in current topics will be emphasized throughout the course.   Recommended background: Properties of matter, basic bonding theory, Lewis structures and molecular orbitals, intermolecular forces. Redox reactions, solution thermodynamics, colligative properties, balancing of chemical reactions. See CH1010 and CH1020. " min-credits="0" max-credits="3" grade-type="normal">

Furthermore, they have enabled the synthesis and application of new electronic materials (e.g. in OLEDs and molecular wires) and materials mimicking natural processes (e.g. self-healing and anti-bacterial coatings). This course will establish principles to understand the reactivity of organometallic compounds of transition and main groups metals. Furthermore, metal-free catalysis will be introduced. Pulling on influences from both inorganic and organic chemistry, the class will provide insight into catalysis approaches that have revolutionized synthetic chemistry, enabling highly efficient, sustainable production of compounds that are used in such different areas as drug discovery, protein analysis, and performance plastics. Case studies will be drawn from the current literature and applications that are widely used in industrial and academic settings and will include work that has led to recent Nobel prizes in the area. Recommended preparation includes the organic chemistry sequence (CH2310, CH2320, and CH2330) and CH3410.

<course number="2102" name="OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN CONCEPTS" course_desc="Cat. I This course introduces students to an object-oriented model of programming. Building from the design methodology covered in CS 1101/CS 1102, this  course shows how programs can be decomposed into classes and objects. By  emphasizing design, this course shows how to implement small defect-free programs and evaluate design decisions to select an optimal design under specific assumptions. Topics include inheritance, exceptions, interface, design by  contract, basic design patterns, and reuse. Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug object-oriented programs composed of multiple classes and over a variety of data structures.  Recommended background: CS 1101 or CS 1102.

The course is designed to strengthen both the design skills and algorithmic thinking of students who already have a foundation in object-oriented programming. Recommended background: CS 1101 or CS 1102 and significant prior experience writing object-oriented programs from scratch. Advanced Placement Computer Science A courses should provide sufficient background; students from AP CS Principles courses or gentler introductions to Java Programming are advised to take CS2102 instead.

<course number="2303" name="SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS" course_desc="Cat. I  This course introduces students to a model of programming where the programming language exposes details of how the hardware stores and executes software. Building from the design concepts covered in CS 2102, this course  covers manual memory management, pointers, the machine stack, and input/ output mechanisms. The course will involve large-scale programming exercises  and will be designed to help students confront issues of safe programming with system-level constructs. The course will cover several tools that assist programmers  in these tasks. Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug  programs in C++ and C. The course presents the material from CS 2301 at a  fast pace and also includes C++ and other advanced topics.  Recommended background: CS 2102 and/or substantial object-oriented programming experience." min-credits="0" max-credits="3" grade-type="normal">

<course number="2019" name="SENSORS, CIRCUITS, AND SYSTEMS" course_desc="Cat. I   This course investigates commonly used sensors such as resistive temperature sensors, capacitive touch sensors, and inductive motion sensors and actuators.  Numerous applications are presented to motivate coverage of fundamental  operating principles of circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and  inductors; model the signals produced by these sensors; and analyze the circuits  and systems used to amplify and process these signals. After a review of  Kirchhoff ‘s current and voltage laws, fundamental analysis techniques such as  Thevenin and Norton’s theorems and the superposition principle are used to  model and analyze sensors, circuits, and systems. Concepts from analysis of  linear, time-invariant continuous-time signals and systems are introduced as  necessary, including Fourier series and characterization of systems such as filters  in both the frequency domain (bandwidth, transfer function) and time domain  (rise time, step response). Capacitance, inductance and mutual inductance are  explored as energy storage elements, including consideration of resonance and  energy losses in power systems. Concepts will be reinforced with the use of  laboratory exercises and computer simulation.

<course number="2029" name="INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL CIRCUIT DESIGN" course_desc="Cat. I   Digital circuits are the foundation upon which the computers, cell phones, and calculators we use every day are built. This course explores these foundations by  using modern digital design techniques to design, implement and test digital  circuits ranging in complexity from basic logic gates to state machines that  perform useful functions like calculations, counting, timing, and a host of other  applications. Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware  description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement  logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and  counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as  field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in  terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments  involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide  students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts  and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students  will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed  using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be  implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment.  Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential  circuits, and synchronous state machines.  Lab exercises: Design, analysis and construction of combinational and  sequential circuits; use of hardware description languages to implement, test, and verify digital circuits; function and operation of FPGAs.   Recommended background: Introductory Electrical and Computer  Engineering concepts covered in a course such as ECE 2010 or RBE 1001, and  MA 1022.

<course number="2049" name="EMBEDDED COMPUTING IN ENGINEERING DESIGN" course_desc="Cat. I   Embedded computers are literally everywhere in modern life. On any given day  we interact with and depend on dozens of small computers to make coffee, run  cell phones, take pictures, play music, control elevators, manage the  emissions and antilock brakes in our automobile, control a home security  system, and so on. Using popular everyday devices as case studies, students in  this course are introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed  by embedded systems. Students will then solve real-world design problems using  small, resource constrained (time/memory/power) computing platforms. The hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic interactions between embedded computers and the physical world will also be  covered in lecture and as part of laboratory experiments. In the laboratory,  emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors  and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD display, SPI ports, pulse  width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed  to use embedded processors in systems design. This course is also appropriate for  RBE and other engineering and CS students interested in learning about  embedded system theory and design.  Topics: Number/data representations, embedded system design using C,  microprocessor and microcontroller architecture, program development and  debugging tools for a small target processor, hardware/software dependencies,  use of memory mapped peripherals, design of event driven software, time and  resource management, applications case studies.  Lab Exercises: Students will solve commonly encountered embedded  processing problems to implement useful systems. Starting with a requirements  list students will use the knowledge gained during the lectures to implement  solutions to problems which explore topics such as user interfaces and  interfacing with the physical world, logic flow, and timing and time constrained  programming. Exercises will be performed on microcontroller and/or  microprocessor based embedded systems using cross platform development tools appropriate to the target platform.   Recommended Background: ECE 2010 or equivalent knowledge in basic  circuits, devices and analysis; and C language programming (CS 2301 or  equivalent)   Suggested Background: ECE 2029 or equivalent knowledge of digital logic,  logic signals and logic operations;   Note: Students who have received credit for ECE 2801 may not receive  credit for ECE 2049." min-credits="2" max-credits="3" grade-type="normal">

I   The object of this course is a comprehensive treatment of electromagnetic engineering principles covering the entire application spectrum from static to  dynamic field phenomena.  The starting point will be the basic electric and magnetic field definitions of Coulomb  and Biot-Savart leading to Gauss’s and Ampere’s laws. They form the foundation of electro- and magnetostatics fields. Students will examine capacitive and inductive  systems and relate them to lumped element circuit models. By introducing tempora l and spatial magnetic flux variations, Faraday’s law is established. The engineering  implications of this law are investigated in terms of transformer and motor actions.  Incorporation of the displacement current density into Ampere’s law and combining it  with Faraday’s law will then culminate in the complete set of Maxwell’s field equations.  As a result of these equations, students will develop the concept of wave propagation in  the time and frequency domain with practical applications such as wireless communication,  radar, Global Positioning Systems, and microwave circuits.

The three areas treated are  detailed analysis and the implementation of cryptoalgorithms,  advanced protocols, and modern attacks  against cryptographic schemes. The first part  of the lecture focuses on public key algorithms, in particular ElGamal, elliptic curves and Diffie- Hellman key exchange. The underlying theory of  Galois fields will be introduced. Implementation  of performance security aspects of the algorithms  will be looked at. The second part of the course  deals with advanced protocols. New schemes for  authentication, identification and zero-knowledge  proof will be introduced. Some complex protocols  for real-world application— such as key distribution  in networks and for smart cards—will be  introduced and analyzed. The third part will look  into state-of-the-art cryptoanalysis (i.e., ways to  break cryptosystems). Brute force attacks based  on special purpose machines, the baby-step giant-step  and the Pohlig-Hellman algorithms will be  discussed.

<course number="401X" name="ARTIFICIAL COMPOSITION" course_desc="In her notes about Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace imagined a computer that could compose elaborate pieces of music. Almost 200 years later, technologies such as Amper Music, LANDR, Cybernetic Poet, and Taroko Gorge have entered domains that have defined human creativity and expressivity. How are we to understand such systems and their output? To what extent can a machine voice that which is elementally human? To what extent are we mechanical or algorithmic in the process of composition? How do the natural and the naturalized relate to artifice and the artificial in this context? In this multidisciplinary course we will bring together computer science, literary studies, and music analysis to explore techniques and technologies including algorithmic composition, asemic writing, automatic writing, machine learning, and human-machine interaction. Project work might include creative, critical, or hybrid interventions concerned with compositional systems, literary works, and/or musical productions.

<course number="2600" name="ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD" course_desc=" Cat. II Environment and development are often seen as incompatible, in part because many poor people in the developing world depend directly on natural resources  for their livelihoods. At the same time, poor people are often seen as responsible  for causing environmental degradation because they lack the knowledge, skills  and resources to manage the environment effectively. The vicious circle is  completed as environmental degradation exacerbates poverty. However,  optimists argue that poor people can and do contribute positively to environmental o utcomes, that states and organizations can facilitate their efforts and  that environmental interventions can coincide with development. This course  will examine these different perspectives on environmental problems in the  developing world through the insights and critiques of social science. Subjects  covered include sustainable development, population, environmental risks, gender, urbanization, environmental decision making, and non-governmental  organizations (NGOs).

Through resilience we can live, and even thrive, in the face of natural disasters. Resilience involves adaptation to the wide range of regional and localized impacts that are expected with a warming planet: more intense storms, greater precipitation, coastal and valley flooding, longer and more severe droughts in some areas, wildfires, melting permafrost, warmer temperatures, and power outages. Resilient design is the intentional design of buildings, landscapes, communities, and regions in response to these vulnerabilities. In this course, we will work to better understand what is at risk in a changing climate with more extreme and frequent disasters, the role people/companies and policies play in these disasters, who is most at risk and why, and develop resilient designs focused on practical, innovative, on-the-ground, and just solutions.

<course number="150X" name="FUNDAMENTALS OF SYSTEMS THINKING" course_desc="Systems Thinking is a holistic approach to problem solving that recognizes that system behavior and performance are the result of underlying structures. Systems Thinking provides tools that enable program managers, systems engineers, scientists, economists, and business managers to identify, understand, and control systems in order to improve system performance.  The Systems Thinking analysis accounts for feedback and resistance to change often exhibited by real world systems. In this course, students will study system identification and delineation, causal loops and feedback diagrams, stock-and-flow diagrams, system leverage points, delays and oscillations, mental models and unintended consequences, and behavior patterns; and use these concepts to improve the performance of engineering, business, and complex social systems. The course will explore great system failures, how they might have been avoided, and how we can learn from them. Finally, students will learn how Systems Thinking explains the occasional irrational behavior of individuals, departments, businesses, and governments. Examples covered in this course may include the failure of strictly technological “fixes” to social issues (as in the government’s installation of wells in Togo in the 1980s,) the 2008 financial meltdown, the failure of the Lockheed L-188 Electra Turboprop Airplane, the failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (“Galloping Gertie”) in 1940, the decline of many commercial fisheries around the world, the failure and success of companies like Research In Motion and Apple, and the unintended consequences of combating drug-related crime.

<course number="2001" name="INTRODUCTION TO MATERIALS SCIENCE" course_desc="Cat. I This beginning course provides important background for all science and engineering disciplines regarding the capabilities and limitations of materials in our everyday lives. Students are introduced to the fundamental theme of materials science-- structure-property-processing relationships—in metals, ceramics, and plastics. Aspects of material structure range from the atomic to microstructural and macroscopic scales. In turn, these structural features determine the properties of materials. In particular, this course investigates connections between structure and mechanical properties, and how working and thermal treatments may transform structure and thus alter material properties. This knowledge is then applied to material selection decisions.      Recommended background: prior knowledge of college-level chemistry. " min-credits="2" max-credits="3" grade-type="normal">

<course number="3100" name="TEACHING METHODS IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE" course_desc="Cat. II Within the context of contemporary secondary education in mathematics and science (biology, chemistry, physics), ID 3100 introduces and demonstrates  effective teaching methods as they relate to curriculum goals and current  methods of assessment. These methods take into account diverse learning styles  as well as various technological resources. Topics to be covered include: a brief  history of education; curriculum and course guidelines (Massachusetts  Education Reform and regulations 603 CMR 7.00, state curricular frameworks,  national standards); legal issues; developing a course syllabus; and the issue of  breadth versus depth in course planning and delivery.

<course number="1120" name="CALCULUS II (SEMESTER VERSION)" course_desc="Cat.I   The topics for integral calculus (MA 1022) are covered in this course: the  concept of the definite integral, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,  integration techniques, and applications of integration. Applications include: area, volume, arc length, center of mass, work, force, and exponential growth  and decay. Logarithmic and exponential functions are studied in depth.  Arithmetic and geometric sequences and series will also be covered. Key historical events in the development of integral calculus are examined. Technology will be used as appropriate to support the material being studied.   This course extends for 14 weeks and offers 1/3 unit of credit.

<course number="1971" name="BRIDGE TO HIGHER MATHEMATICS" course_desc="Cat. I  The principal aim of this course is to introduce and enhance mathematical thinking. The course is intended not only for beginning mathematics, statistics or actuarial students, but also for students seeking to further their mathematical interests and those simply curious about logic and reason. Students in the course will be expected to explain, justify, defend, disprove, conjecture and verify mathematical ideas, both verbally and in writing. One expected by-product of this training is that students will develop concrete proof-writing skills which will improve their prospects for success in more advanced mathematics courses. When appropriate, course discussion will touch on current events in the mathematical sciences, including recently solved problems and open challenges facing today&apos;s scientists.

They will also be exposed to associated  issues in manufacturing process analysis, engineering design, material science,  and in dimensional and surface metrology. Using machining as an example, the  science of manufacturing processes is developed in a combination of class work  and laboratory experience. The laboratory experience includes an experimental component that relates process variables in machining with performance and  machined part quality. Students whose project work will necessitate fabrication  of parts and those who want a background in manufacturing process science and  engineering should take this course." min-credits="2" max-credits="3" grade-type="normal">

<course number="5200" name="MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS" course_desc="The course provides fundamentals for vibration an alysis of linear discrete and continuous dynamic systems. A vibrating system is first modeled  mathematically as an initial value problem (IVP)  or a boundary-initial value problem (BIVP) by the  Newton-D’Alembert method and/or the Lagrange  energy approach and then solved for various types  of system. Explicit solutions for dynamic response  of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system,  both damped and undamped, is derived for  free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and  forced vibration caused by different excitations.  Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration  response of both multi-degree-of-freedom  (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with  distributed parameters. As the basis of modal  analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration  modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained  in advance by solving an associated generalized  eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties  of the vibration modes with respect to the  stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved.

Applications are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is based on the premise that there are common aspects to all good designs.  These commons aspects, stated in the independence and information axioms, facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline.  Analysis of processes and products is considered from the perspective of supporting product and process design.  Fundamental methods of engineering analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are developed.  Special attention is given to examples in machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surfaces.  The ability to generalize is emphasized to facilitate development of analyses and design methods with broader applicability. The content is delivered in video lectures and in readings from the technical literature. The grade is from performance on homework and quizzes given and delivered on-line and on a design project on manufacturing processes.  Projects can be from work or dissertations on many kinds of systems and services, in addition to traditional manufacturing processes and tools.

<course number="4022" name="LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT II" course_desc="Cat. I (1/6 unit)   This Course focuses on completing the transition from cadet to lieutenant. As  an expansion of the Ethics instruction in ML 3021, the course starts with an  examination of unit ethical climate and the commander&apos;s role as the moral  anchor of the unit. This is followed by a module addressing military law and  leadership. The next module reinforces previous instruction on the organization  of the Army and introduces how the Army organizes for operations from the  tactical to strategic level. This is followed by instruction on administrative and  logistical management that focuses on the fundamentals of soldier and unit level support. Next is a short module that focuses on preparing cadets for their  forthcoming commissioning and military service. At the core of this semester is the Advanced Course&apos;s Capstone Exercise. This twelve-lesson exercise directly  reinforces all modules from this term, and also incorporates and reinforces many learning objectives from modules throughout the entire curriculum. The  Capstone Exercise requires cadets, both individually and collectively, to apply  their knowledge to solve problems and confront situations commonly faced by  junior officers. Upon completion of this course the cadets will be prepared to  shoulder the responsibility of being a commissioned officer in the United States  Army.

The course will focus  heavily on the use of technology to solve problems  involving applications of calculus concepts. In addition,  MME students will be expected to master  the mathematical rigor of these calculus concepts  so that they will be better prepared to develop  their own projects and laboratory assignments. For  example, if an MME student chose to develop a  lab on convergence of sequence, he/she would be  expected to understand the rigorous definition of convergence and how to apply it to gain sufficient  and/or necessary conditions for convergence. The process of developing these first-year calculus  assignments will enable the MME students to  increase their own mathematical understanding of  concepts while learning to handle mathematical  and computer issues which will be encountered by  their own calculus students. Their understanding  of the concepts and applications of calculus will be  further reinforced through computer laboratory  assignments and group projects.

Applications are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is based on the premise that there are common aspects to all good designs.  These commons aspects, stated in the independence and information axioms, facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline.  Analysis of processes and products is considered from the perspective of supporting product and process design.  Fundamental methods of engineering analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are developed.  Special attention is given to examples in machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surfaces.  The ability to generalize is emphasized to facilitate development of analyses and design methods with broader applicability. The content is delivered in video lectures and in readings from the technical literature. The grade is from performance on homework and quizzes given and delivered on-line and on a design project on manufacturing processes.  Projects can be from work or dissertations on many kinds of systems and services, in addition to traditional manufacturing processes and tools.

Music will be used as a tool and device to examine issues such as wars, genocide, assassinations, religious persecution, refugee/homelessness, and personal suffering. Works to be examined may include: Benjamin Britten’s War Requiem and Olivier Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time – a critique and reaction of World War II; David Lang’s Little Match Girl Passion – an expression of abuse and homelessness; and James MacMillan’s Cantos Sagrodos – a work highlighting the tragedies of political repression in Latin America. Along with the music, there may also be discussion of individual artists who have been outspoken about social issues, such as Leonard Bernstein in the 1960s, Dimitri Shostakovich under Stalin’s rule, and contemporary pop and jazz artists.

How do we organize these elements in time to create rhythms, melodies, phrases and pieces? How do perception and memory interact to allow us navigate a musical work?  We will explore these questions by considering the cognitive and perceptual processes that shape our musical experience.  Topics will include event distinction, temporal perception, hierarchical organization, perceptual grouping, expertise, memory and categorization. We will illustrate these ideas in musical contexts by listening to a variety of musical works. We will consider how psychological principles are applied to music technologies, such as compression algorithms, mixing methodologies and the field of music information retrieval.  We will consider experiments that focus on some of these topics to further our understanding about how we experience music.

<course number="2651" name="INTERMEDIATE PHYSICS LABORATORY" course_desc="Cat. I   This course offers experience in experimentation and observation for students of the sciences and others. In a series of subject units, students learn or review the physical principles underlying the phenomena to be observed and the basis for  the measurement techniques employed. Principles and uses of laboratory  instruments including the cathode-ray oscilloscope, meters for frequency, time,  electrical and other quantities are stressed. In addition to systematic measurement  procedures and data recording, strong emphasis is placed on processing of  the data, preparation and interpretation of graphical presentations, and analysis  of precision and accuracy, including determination and interpretation of best  value, measures of error and uncertainty, linear best fit to data, and identification  of systematic and random errors. Preparation of high-quality experiment reports  is also emphasized. Representative experiment subjects are: mechanical motions  and vibrations; free and driven electrical oscillations; electric fields and potential;  magnetic materials and fields; electron beam dynamics; optics; diffractiongrating  spectroscopy; radioactive decay and nuclear energy measurements.   Recommended background: the Introductory Physics course sequence or equivalent. No prior laboratory background beyond that experience is required.

What are the sources of those responsibilities? The course will focus both on professional and personal dilemmas and will help students think through some moral problems that are likely to confront them in their professional and personal lives. The class should also help prepare students to navigate through the tough moral issues they are likely to face, either as a medical professional, a citizen, a parent, a child of parents, or as potentially a sick person themselves. This class proposes to grant students the reflective time to read some of the most eloquent authors on suffering, caretaking, and sickness (for example, Oliver Sacks, Jerome Groopman, Susan Sontag, Leo Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf, Tony Kushner, Tracy Kidder, Perri Klass, etc.) and to express their reflections on these resources in effective communication.

II Spirituality is a philosophical perspective which stresses the role of virtue in happiness and morality; a psychological perspective on emotions and desire; and an essential dimension of religious life. Found in all religions, it is also personally important for the tens of millions who describe themselves as &quot;spiritual but not religious.&quot; This course will investigate the many dimensions of spiritual thought and practice, focusing on questions such as: What similarities/differences exist among the spiritual teachings of traditional religions? What is a spiritual experience, a spiritual lesson, a spiritual life? What is the role of spiritual practices such as yoga, meditation, and prayer? What is the place of spirituality in medicine (e.g., meditation as treatment for stress), our relation to nature (e.g., the experience of a sunset), and political life (e.g., Gandhi, King, spiritual environmentalism)? Beyond scientific knowledge, technological expertise, and common sense, is there such a thing as wisdom?      Recommended background: PY/RE 1731, Introduction to Philosophy and Religion.

<course number="2520" name="MODELING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS" course_desc="Cat. II The purpose of this course is to prepare students to construct original system dynamics computer simulation models of economic and social systems from real world situations. They are coached to experiment with these models to understand unintended consequences of policy and to design effective policy interventions. Such a modeling process can be used to examine the possible impacts of policy changes and technological innovations on socioeconomic systems. The curriculum in this course covers a detailed examination of the steps of the system dynamics modeling process: problem identification (including data collection and analysis), feedback structure conceptualization, model formulation, model testing and analysis, model documentation and presentation, and policy implementation, illustrated by examples from business, economy and social systems.

His “Stanislavski Method” is one of the most influential acting approaches in the 20th and 21st centuries. This approach will include analysis and exploration “on our feet” of such terms as unit, objective, subtext, action, among others, as well as focus on incorporating characterization and given circumstances. We will do this through in-class exercises, as well as monologue and scenework onstage and on video from a variety of texts that employ naturalistic language (for example, Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull, Tennessee William’s The Glass Menagerie, Lynn Nottage’s Sweat, and Theresa Rebeck’s Mauritius, among others.) Further, we will explore the historical and social background of these playwrights in order to contextualize the ideas and mores behind the drama. Additionally, each actor will be expected to do research in order to better prepare themselves to dive into these theatrical worlds. Beyond acting skills, the student will learn valuable skills in public speaking and in conveying clear, complex ideas.
